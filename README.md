Model Craft is a toolkit for fine-tuning and distilling Large Language Models (LLMs) with ease. This project allows AI researchers and enthusiasts to craft their own LLMs and push them to Hugging Face's model hub.

## Quick Start

All you need is to:
1. open google colab
2. install this repo
3. import widget
4. custimize the config
5. hit the button "SAVEâœ…" and run the training.

### Prerequisites

- Google Colab account
- Hugging Face account

### Usage

Open new google colab notebook.

Make sure your runtime is on GPU (ex. T4 GPU) 

## 1. **Install Dependencies**
   
   ```bash
   %%capture
   !pip install datasets transformers evaluate accelerate 
   ```

## 2. **Clone the Repository and make it global**
   
   ```bash
   %%capture
   !git clone https://github.com/nikitakapitan/modelcraft.git
   %cd modelcraft
   !pip install .
```


## 3. Customize your config


Import the finetune widget and customize it.

   ```bash
   from modelcraft import widget
   widget()
```

</p>

## 4. Run the job:

### Finetune Your Model

  ```bash
  !python finetune.py --config config.yaml
  ```

### Distill Your Model
  ```bash
  !python distill.py --config config.yaml
  ```

Done âœ… Your new model is automatically pushed to your Hugging Face account ðŸ¤—
